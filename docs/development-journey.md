# Development Journey with Windsurf

This document tracks the conversation and development process of creating our recipe management website using Windsurf IDE.

## Session: December 9, 2024

### Prompt 1: Initial Project Setup
**User Request:** Start a new portfolio project using PACT framework for designing the system.

**Response Summary:**
- Created initial `README.md` with PACT framework structure
- Established basic project directory structure:
  ```
  personal-website/
  ├── README.md
  ├── docs/
  │   └── pact-analysis.md
  ├── src/
  │   ├── frontend/
  │   └── backend/
  └── tests/
  ```
- Created detailed PACT analysis template in `docs/pact-analysis.md`

### Prompt 2: Persona Creation
**User Request:** Create two personas - a Cuban female developer and her Australian husband, both with specific cooking styles and needs.

**Response Summary:**
- Created `personas.md` with detailed profiles:
  1. Isabella Rodriguez (39, Cuban, Frontend Developer)
     - Methodical cooking style
     - Uses precise measurements (deciliters)
     - Research-oriented approach
  
  2. James Thompson (41, Australian, Senior Developer)
     - Intuitive cooking style
     - Freestyle measurement approach
     - Spontaneous recipe creation

- Updated PACT analysis with specific requirements based on personas:
  - Dual input methods for different cooking styles
  - Measurement conversion features
  - Private access system
  - Collaborative features
  - Mobile-friendly design
  - Image upload capabilities
  - Comments and variations tracking

### Prompt 3: Technical Stack Definition
**User Request:** Define technical stack based on team's expertise - TypeScript, React Vite, Node.js, C#, and ASP.NET Core.

**Response Summary:**
- Created `technical-stack.md` with comprehensive technology choices:
  - Frontend: React with Vite, TypeScript
  - Backend: ASP.NET Core, C#
  - Database: SQL Server
  - Infrastructure: Azure services
- Updated personas with detailed technical backgrounds
- Defined project structure for both frontend and backend
- Outlined key features implementation approach
- Established development workflow

### Key Technical Decisions:
1. Leveraging Isabella's frontend expertise with React and TypeScript
2. Utilizing James's backend proficiency with ASP.NET Core
3. Using Azure cloud services for scalability and reliability
4. Implementing modern development practices with Docker and CI/CD

### Key Insights from Development Process:
1. Using PACT framework helps structure user-centered design
2. Detailed personas provide clear direction for feature development
3. Combining different user approaches (methodical vs. intuitive) requires flexible system design

### Next Steps:
- Set up development environment
- Create initial project structure
- Implement basic authentication
- Develop measurement conversion service
- Technical architecture design
- User interface mockups
- Database schema design
- Feature prioritization

This document will continue to be updated as we progress through the development process, showcasing how Windsurf IDE facilitates efficient project development and collaboration.
