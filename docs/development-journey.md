# Development Journey with Windsurf

This document tracks the conversation and development process of creating our recipe management website using Windsurf IDE.

## Session: December 9, 2024

### Prompt 1: Initial Project Setup
**User Request:** Start a new portfolio project using PACT framework for designing the system.

**Response Summary:**
- Created initial `README.md` with PACT framework structure
- Established basic project directory structure:
  ```
  personal-website/
  ├── README.md
  ├── docs/
  │   └── pact-analysis.md
  ├── src/
  │   ├── frontend/
  │   └── backend/
  └── tests/
  ```
- Created detailed PACT analysis template in `docs/pact-analysis.md`

### Prompt 2: Persona Creation
**User Request:** Create two personas - a Cuban female developer and her Australian husband, both with specific cooking styles and needs.

**Response Summary:**
- Created `personas.md` with detailed profiles:
  1. Isabella Rodriguez (39, Cuban, Frontend Developer)
     - Methodical cooking style
     - Uses precise measurements (deciliters)
     - Research-oriented approach
  
  2. James Thompson (41, Australian, Senior Developer)
     - Intuitive cooking style
     - Freestyle measurement approach
     - Spontaneous recipe creation

- Updated PACT analysis with specific requirements based on personas:
  - Dual input methods for different cooking styles
  - Measurement conversion features
  - Private access system
  - Mobile-friendly design
  - Image upload capabilities

### Prompt 3: Technical Stack Definition
**User Request:** Define technical stack based on team's expertise - TypeScript, React Vite, Node.js, C#, and ASP.NET Core.

**Response Summary:**
- Created `technical-stack.md` with comprehensive technology choices:
  ## Technical Stack
  - **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
  - **Backend**: .NET Core with C#
  - **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
  - **Database**: SQL Server
  - **Build Tool**: Vite
  - **Styling**: Styled Components
  - **Routing**: React Router v6
  - **State Management**: React Hooks
  - **Utilities**: 
    - Axios for HTTP requests
    - UUID for unique identifiers
- Updated personas with detailed technical backgrounds
- Defined project structure for both frontend and backend
- Outlined key features implementation approach
- Established development workflow

### Prompt 4: UI/UX Design Exploration
**User Request:** Elaborate on the user interface design approach before implementation.

**Response Summary:**
- Created `ui-design.md` with comprehensive design documentation:
  - Detailed screen layouts
  - Color scheme and typography
  - Responsive design approach

### Key Insights from Development Process:
1. Using PACT framework helps structure user-centered design
2. Detailed personas provide clear direction for feature development
3. Combining different user approaches (methodical vs. intuitive) requires flexible system design

### Data Structure Design (2024-12-13)

### Core Data Models
Windsurf proposed TypeScript interfaces for the recipe management system. These interfaces defined the structure of our data and guided both frontend and backend development.

### Key Considerations for Implementation

1. **Data Storage**
2. **Search and Filter Capabilities**

This data structure design aims to support both current requirements and future feature additions while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

### Next Steps:
- Create UI component library (done)
- Implement design system (done)
- Develop prototype screens (done)
- User testing with both personas
- Set up development environment (done)
- Create initial project structure (done)
- Implement basic authentication
- Develop measurement conversion service
- Technical architecture design
- Database schema design (done)
- Feature prioritization

This document will continue to be updated as we progress through the development process, showcasing how Windsurf IDE facilitates efficient project development and collaboration.

### Prompt 5: Initial Figma Implementation (December 14, 2024)
**User Request:** Created initial Figma prototype and component library based on design guidelines.

**Response Summary:**
Created initial prototype screens:
- Home page with search and navigation
- Recipe detail page
- Unit converter interface
- Side menu (full and minimal versions)
- Recipe creation form

**Component Library Progress:**
1. Core Components:
   - Create Recipe
   - Recipe view
   - Tile component
   - Side menu (full version)
   - Burger menu with side menu toggle
   - Application Header navigation menu
   - Button
   - Inputs
   - Recipes Index page

2. Pending Components:
   - User profile button/icon
   - Search bar in header
   - Authentication system
   - Unit converter
