# Development Journey with Windsurf

This document tracks the conversation and development process of creating our recipe management website using Windsurf IDE.

## Session: December 9, 2024

### Prompt 1: Initial Project Setup
**User Request:** Start a new portfolio project using PACT framework for designing the system.

**Response Summary:**
- Created initial `README.md` with PACT framework structure
- Established basic project directory structure:
  ```
  personal-website/
  ├── README.md
  ├── docs/
  │   └── pact-analysis.md
  ├── src/
  │   ├── frontend/
  │   └── backend/
  └── tests/
  ```
- Created detailed PACT analysis template in `docs/pact-analysis.md`

### Prompt 2: Persona Creation
**User Request:** Create two personas - a Cuban female developer and her Australian husband, both with specific cooking styles and needs.

**Response Summary:**
- Created `personas.md` with detailed profiles:
  1. Isabella Rodriguez (39, Cuban, Frontend Developer)
     - Methodical cooking style
     - Uses precise measurements (deciliters)
     - Research-oriented approach
  
  2. James Thompson (41, Australian, Senior Developer)
     - Intuitive cooking style
     - Freestyle measurement approach
     - Spontaneous recipe creation

- Updated PACT analysis with specific requirements based on personas:
  - Dual input methods for different cooking styles
  - Measurement conversion features
  - Private access system
  - Collaborative features
  - Mobile-friendly design
  - Image upload capabilities
  - Comments and variations tracking

### Prompt 3: Technical Stack Definition
**User Request:** Define technical stack based on team's expertise - TypeScript, React Vite, Node.js, C#, and ASP.NET Core.

**Response Summary:**
- Created `technical-stack.md` with comprehensive technology choices:
  - Frontend: React with Vite, TypeScript
  - Backend: ASP.NET Core, C#
  - Database: SQL Server
  - Infrastructure: Azure services
- Updated personas with detailed technical backgrounds
- Defined project structure for both frontend and backend
- Outlined key features implementation approach
- Established development workflow

### Prompt 4: UI/UX Design Exploration
**User Request:** Elaborate on the user interface design approach before implementation.

**Response Summary:**
- Created `ui-design.md` with comprehensive design documentation:
  - Dual-mode interface (Structured/Freestyle)
  - Kitchen-friendly design principles
  - Detailed screen layouts
  - Color scheme and typography
  - Responsive design approach
  - Accessibility considerations

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. Dual-mode recipe creation to support both personas' cooking styles
2. Kitchen-friendly interface with large, touch-friendly elements
3. Prominent measurement conversion tools
4. Real-time collaboration features
5. Responsive design for all devices
6. Accessibility-first approach

### Key Technical Decisions:
1. Leveraging Isabella's frontend expertise with React and TypeScript
2. Utilizing James's backend proficiency with ASP.NET Core
3. Using Azure cloud services for scalability and reliability
4. Implementing modern development practices with Docker and CI/CD

### Key Insights from Development Process:
1. Using PACT framework helps structure user-centered design
2. Detailed personas provide clear direction for feature development
3. Combining different user approaches (methodical vs. intuitive) requires flexible system design

### Data Structure Design (2024-12-13)

### Core Data Models
Below are the proposed TypeScript interfaces for the recipe management system. These interfaces define the structure of our data and will guide both frontend and backend development.

#### User Profile
```typescript
interface User {
    id: string;
    username: string;
    displayName: string;
    profilePicture: string;
    email: string;
    preferences: {
        defaultMetricSystem: 'metric' | 'imperial';
        defaultPortionSize: number;
    };
    createdAt: timestamp;
    lastActive: timestamp;
}
```

#### Recipe Core
```typescript
interface Recipe {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    author: {
        id: string;

    };
    origin: {
        country: string;
        region?: string;
        attribution: 'original' | 'adapted' | 'copied';

        sourceName?: string;
    };
    difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
    preparationTime: number; // minutes
    cookingTime: number; // minutes
    restingTime?: number; // minutes
    totalTime: number; // calculated
    servings: {
        default: number;
        min: number;
        max: number;
    };
    nutrition?: {
        calories: number;
        protein: number;
        carbs: number;
        fat: number;
        // per serving
    };
    tags: string[]; // for filtering: vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.
    category: string[]; // main dish, dessert, etc.
    season?: string[]; // summer, winter, etc.
    occasion?: string[]; // birthday, christmas, etc.
    equipment: string[]; // required kitchen tools
    temperature?: {
        value: number;
        unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit';
    };
    cost: 'budget' | 'moderate' | 'expensive';
    ratings: {
        average: number;
        count: number;
    };
    status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'archived';
    createdAt: timestamp;
    updatedAt: timestamp;
    lastCooked?: timestamp;
    isFavorite: boolean;
    notes: string;
}
```

#### Recipe Components
```typescript
interface IngredientSection {
    id: string;
    recipeId: string;
    title: string; // e.g., "Dough", "Filling", "Sauce"
    order: number;
    ingredients: Ingredient[];
}

interface Ingredient {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    quantity: number;
    unit: string; // g, ml, cups, etc.
    notes?: string;
    isOptional: boolean;
    substitutes?: string[];
    preparation?: string; // "chopped", "diced", etc.
}

interface InstructionStep {
    id: string;
    recipeId: string;
    stepNumber: number;
    description: string;
    images?: string[];
    duration?: number; // minutes
    temperature?: {

        unit: 'celsius' | 'fahrenheit';
    };
    tips?: string;
    warningNotes?: string;
    isOptional: boolean;
}
```

#### Additional Metadata
```typescript
interface RecipeMetadata {
    collections: string[]; // user-defined collections
    mealPlanDates: timestamp[];
    sharedWith: string[]; // user IDs
    privacyLevel: 'private' | 'shared' | 'public';
    version: number; // for recipe iterations
    parentRecipeId?: string; // if it's a variation
    translations?: {
        [languageCode: string]: {
            title: string;
            description: string;
            instructions: string[];
        }
    };
    dietaryInfo: {
        allergens: string[];
        restrictions: string[];
        certifications?: string[]; // kosher, halal, etc.
    };
}
```

### Key Considerations for Implementation

1. **Data Storage Requirements**
   - Flexible schema for recipe variations
   - Strong relationships between components
   - Support for real-time updates
   - Efficient querying capabilities
   - Image storage and optimization

2. **Search and Filter Capabilities**
   - Full-text search across recipes
   - Filter by multiple criteria (tags, categories, time, etc.)
   - Sort by various parameters
   - Support for partial matching
   - Performance optimization for large datasets

3. **Future Extensibility**
   - Version control for recipes
   - Measurement conversion system
   - Shopping list generation
